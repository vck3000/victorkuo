# Hello, World!

![fireworks](fireworks.jpg)

Welcome to my blog! Today is the start of 2021 and it's the perfect time to start a blog :). I'm not sure where this blogging will take me, but for the meantime I'll just jot down some of the things I've done in the past and present that hopefully interest you! 

## About me
It's difficult to summarise my thoughts in a few lines, but here is my best shot: I'm a final year engineering + science student at The University of Sydney. I love robotics, programming, engineering and the likes which there'll be no shortage of in future posts! 

Outside of technical engineering work, I love adventuring, flying, scuba diving, hiking and challenging myself. I used to be an avid gamer (LoL, Dota 1, Dota 2, CSGO, Minecraft) having played pretty much every popular multiplayer game of my time. Unfortunately I never got very far in that domain... 

Now-a-days I spend my time off learning Chinese and Japanese, and slowly griding through all those One Piece episodes while trying to stop myself from doing more programming (it's actually a problem for me)!
